## Problem Description

ABC is a pharmaceutical business that wants to know the persistency of a drug after a physician has prescribed it for a patient. This company has approached an analytics firm to automate the identifying procedure. This analytics firm has entrusted our team with the task of developing a solution to automate the persistence of a medicine for the client ABC.

## Business Understanding
One of the long-lasting business issues in the world of pharmaceutical companies is the persistency of drugs which can significantly affect the outcome of medical treatments. One of the important factors that is related to persistency is the adherence of the patient to the prescribed regimens, meaning if the patient is committed to the prescribed regimens or not. There is a lot of information about Non-Tuberculous Mycobacterial (NTM) infections. In fact, related studies show that around 50%-60% of the patients with different illnesses in US miss doses, take the wrong doses, or drop off treatment in the first year. (reference 1). Additionally, the illness, either chronic or acute can be related to the adherence and persistency of drugs.

ABC company also one of pharmaceutical companies, wants to know how long a medicine will last in a patient's system (persistency of a drug). Based on prescription data, the ABC corporation needs to determine whether a patient is persistent or not. ABC pharma would manufacture medicines in that number based on the persistency count so that they could operate their firm effectively and avoid the risks of NTM infections.
